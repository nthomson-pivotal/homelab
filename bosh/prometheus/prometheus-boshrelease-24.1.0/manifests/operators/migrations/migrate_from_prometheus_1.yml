# This op-file allows keeping an existing Prometheus 1.x running until the data its holding is no longer relevant.
# Any queries to the Prometheus 2.0 will transparently pull data from the Prometheus 1.x as needed.
# Once the Prometheus 1.x data is no longer relevant, remove this file and the old job will be deleted.
